Roamaor
=======

This is a ~~spoof~~ epic MMORPG created solely as an exercise in Go and D3js. The rest of the stack includes MongoDB, AngularJS,
and Compass/Sass/Zurb for the markup and styling.

It is wildly incomplete and will be for some time to come.

I'll continue to work on it when higher priorities aren't in the way.

In the meantime, enjoy this fantastical screenshot!
